4158 lncRNA-protein interactions were selected according to the previous study(Zhang et al., 2018), which is shown in the Interaction matrix.csv.
The Ensembl ID of 990 lncRNAs is shown in the LncRNA.csv, and the LncRNA Sequence.txt collect the sequence of all 990 lncRNAs.
Similarly， the Uniprot ID of 27 proteins is shown in the Protein.csv, and the Protein Sequence.txt collect the sequence of all 27 proteins.
The Final score matrix.csv is the final prediction matrix of our model, what's more, the prediction matrix of other models is shown in the file, Other methods prediction matrix.
