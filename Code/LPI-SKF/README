There are three different Matlab codes in this folder, the LPI-SKF.m is used to predict uncover lncRNA-protein interactions, 
the LPI_SKF_new_lncRNA.m is used to predict lncRNA-protein interactions for new lncRNAs, 
and the LPI_SKF_new_protein.m is used to predict lncRNA-protein interactions for new proteins.You can run these codes directly.  
The data.mat including the lncRNA expression profile similarity, the protein pairwise sequence alignment similarity, and the sequence statistical feature similarity of lncRNAs and proteins.
